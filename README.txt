Generates a graph with global winrate stats.

1. Open sc2dsstats.exe

2. Follow the instructions

Analysing the replays will need a lot of diskspace - expect ~800 MB for every 100 DS replays. 

Depending on the number of Replays it will take some time to compute - you can restart the prozess at any point, it will continue at the last position.

You can right click on a graph-image to save it (or left click to open in new window). 

Have fun.
