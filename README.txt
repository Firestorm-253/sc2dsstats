Generates a graph with global winrate stats.

1. Edit the config.txt file located in the same folder as this file. 

2. Execute the doit.cmd script

3. If success there will be an stats.png file in the same folder as this file containing your stats.


Analysing the replays will need a lot of diskspace - expect ~800 MB for every 100 DS replays. 

Depending on the number of Replays it will take some time to compute - you can restart the prozess at any point, it will continue at the last position.

Have fun.
